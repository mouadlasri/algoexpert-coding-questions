#   Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted
#   in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares
#   of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.

# sample input = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]
# sample output = [1, 4, 9, 25, 36, 64, 81]
