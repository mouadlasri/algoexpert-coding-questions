#   Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an
#   integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum
#   up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any
#   order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return
#   an empty array.

#   Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing two different integers
#   in the array; you can't add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the
#   target sum.


#   You can assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to
#   the target sum.


# O(n) time | O(n) space

    seenTracker = {}

    for num in array:
        potentialMatch = targetSum - num # x + y = targetsum => y = targetSum - x (x: num)
        if potentialMatch in seenTracker:
            return [potentialMatch, num]
        else:
            # add the num to the dictionary
            seenTracker[num] = True
            
    return []
